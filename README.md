# Mobile App Starter Kit

![banner](https://github.com/hellojulian/mobile-starter-kit/blob/main/banner.jpg)

## A mobile app starter kit featuring a clean and well-organized design system. Built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for React Native, it offers a curated collection of components that can be easily scaled to fit your design needs.

Crafted with [NativeWind v4](https://www.nativewind.dev/) and accessibility in mind, `react-native-reusables` is open source, offering a foundation for developing your own high-quality component library. If you'd like access to the Figma UI Kit, please send me a message and I'll give you a private link.
